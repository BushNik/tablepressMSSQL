TablePress enables you to create and manage tables, without having to write HTML code, and it adds valuable functions for your visitors.

== Description ==

TablePress enables you to create and manage tables in your WP Dashboard. No HTML knowledge is needed. A comfortable backend allows to easily edit table data. Tables can contain any type of data and an additional JavaScript library can be used to extend it with features like sorting, pagination, filtering, and more. You can include the tables into your posts, on your pages, or in text widgets by using a Shortcode or a template tag function. Tables can be imported and exported from/to CSV, HTML, and JSON.

= Where can I find answers to Frequently Asked Questions? =

A wide group of questions, regarding different features or styling has been answered in the [FAQ section](http://tobias.baethge.com/wordpress/plugins/tablepress/faq/) on the plugin's website.

= Support? =

For support questions, bug reports, or feature requests, please use the [WordPress Support Forums](http://wordpress.org/tags/tablepress). Please [search](http://wordpress.org/support/) through the forums first, then [open a new thread](http://wordpress.org/tags/tablepress) with the tag "tablepress". Thank you!

= Requirements? =

In short: WordPress 3.1 or higher, the latest version of WordPress is recommended

= Languages and Localization? =

The plugin currently includes the following languages:
English and German.

I'd really appreciate it, if you would translate the plugin into your language! Using Heiko Rabe's WordPress plugin [Codestyling Localization](http://www.code-styling.de/english/development/wordpress-plugin-codestyling-localization-en/) that really is as easy as pie. Just install the plugin, add your language, create the .po-file, translate the strings in the comfortable editor and create the .mo-file. It will automatically be saved in TablePress's plugin folder. If you send me the .mo- and .po-file, I will gladly include them into future plugin releases.
There is also a .pot-file available to use in the "i18n" subfolder. Of course you can also use poEdit as your editor, which also works nicely.

== Usage ==

After installing the plugin, you can add, import, export, edit, copy, delete, ... tables via the "TablePress" screen which appears under the "Tools" section in your Admin menu.
Everything should be self-explaining there.

To show one of your tables in a post, on a page or in a text widget, just include the Shortcode `[table id=&lt;the-id&gt; /]` to your post/page/text-widget, where `&lt;the-id&gt` is the ID of your table (can be found on the left side of the "List tables" screen.)

After that you might want to change the style of the table. You can do this by entering CSS commands into the "Custom CSS" textarea on the "Plugin Options" screen.
You may also add certain features (like sorting, pagination, filtering, alternating row colors, row highlighting, print name and/or description, ...) by checking the appropriate options on the "Edit table" screen.
